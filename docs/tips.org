#+TITLE: Tips

1. Use =F10= or =M-x menu-bar-open= to interact with the menu bar.
2. Default Global Magit keys
   1. =C-x g= (magit-status)
   2. =C-x M-g= (magit-dispatch)
   3. =C-c M-g= (magit-file-dispatch) -> I remapped to =C-c g=
3. Nice file dispatch magit commands
   1. blame =C-c g b=
   2. stage the current file =C-c g s=
   3. commit the current file =C-c g c=
   4. show the git log for the current file =C-c g l=
   5. show the diff for the current file =C-c g d=
4. Delete branch using Magit
   1. Press =y= to get a listing of all branches and tags in the git repo
   2. Navigate to the branch you want to delete and press =k=
5. Travel back and forward in git history
   1. =w= copy the hash of the current historic version
6. While using IDO to switch buffers, you can kill buffers with =C-k=
7. I should use =bk/ispell-word-then-abbrev= with =C-u= if I want to add the word to local abbrev table
8. Easy kill cheatsheet
