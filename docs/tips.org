#+TITLE: Tips

1. Use =F10= or =M-x menu-bar-open= to interact with the menu bar.
2. Default Global Magit keys
   1. =C-x g= (magit-status)
   2. =C-x M-g= (magit-dispatch)
   3. =C-c g= (magit-file-dispatch)
3. Nice file dispatch magit commands
   1. blame =C-c g b=
   2. stage the current file =C-c g s=
   3. commit the current file =C-c g c=
   4. show the git log for the current file =C-c g l=
   5. show the diff for the current file =C-c g d=
4. Delete branch using Magit
   1. Press =y= to get a listing of all branches and tags in the git repo
   2. Navigate to the branch you want to delete and press =k=
5. Travel back and forward in git history
   1. =w= copy the hash of the current historic version
6. While using IDO to switch buffers, you can kill buffers with =C-k=
7. I should use =bk/ispell-word-then-abbrev= with =C-u= if I want to add the word to local abbrev table

   | M-w w      | save word at point                  |
   | M-w s      | save sexp at point                  |
   | M-w l      | save list at point (enclosing sexp) |
   | M-w d      | save defun at point                 |
   | M-w D      | save current defun's name           |
   | M-w f      | save filename at point              |
   | M-w b      | save =buffer-file-name=             |

9. [ORG] Make a heading a new Roam node
   1. use =M-x org-id-get-create=
10. add parens when unbalanced in Paredit using =C-q )=
11. remove stray parens using =C-u DEL=
12. =C-t= to toggle regexp search in IDO
13. Isearch cheatsheet
    | keybinding  | description                                                     |
    |-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | C-s or C-r  | navigate through occurrences                                    |
    | M-e         | edit the current search pattern                                 |
    | M-n and M-p | cycle through previous search pattern                           |
    | M-s-o       | switch the results of the search to =occur=                     |
    | M-r         | to switch to regexp search                                      |
    | M-c         | to toggle the case sensitivity                                  |
    | RET         | to stop searching                                               |
    | C-u C-SPACE | go back to the position before searching                        |
    | C-s C-s     | search for the last pattern searched                            |
    | C-s C-w     | search the word at point [extend selection with multiple =C-w=] |
    | M-s .       | search the wider word at point                                  |
14. Some snippets in =Clojure Mode= that are really useful right now
    - defn
    - fn
    - clock
    - ifl
    - map
    - print
    - reduce
    - opts
    - is
    - test
    - ->
    - ->>
    - try
    - whenl
15. we can bookmark Info nodes too. just use =C-x r m= as usual
16. use =diff-hl-show-hunk= functions
    1. If you want to navigate to next changed hunk =diff-hl-show-hunk-next=
