#+TITLE: Bookmark

Emacs bookmarking makes use of three things that are related but
different: a bookmark list, a bookmark file, and a bookmark list
display.

Some commands:

- =C-x r m= set a bookmark at the current location
- =C-x r b= jump to a bookmark
- =C-x r l= list your bookmarks
- =M-x bookmark-delete= delete a bookmark by name
